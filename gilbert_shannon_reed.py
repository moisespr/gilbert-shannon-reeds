# From Wikipedia:
# > In the mathematics of shuffling playing cards, the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model is
# a probability distribution on riffle shuffle permutations that has been reported to
# be a good match for experimentally observed outcomes of human shuffling, and that
# forms the basis for a recommendation that a deck of cards should be riffled seven
# times in order to thoroughly randomize it. ... The deck of cards is cut into two
# packets... [t]hen, one card at a time is repeatedly moved from the bottom of one of
# the packets to the top of the shuffled deck.
# Here we implement the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model, and verify this recommendation of seven shuffles.
# Note that the functions below have `doctest` examples.
# To test the functions, just run `pytest` in the top level of the repository.
# First, define a function to determine how many cards to split into our right hand.
