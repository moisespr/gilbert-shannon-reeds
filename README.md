From Wikipedia:

> In the mathematics of shuffling playing cards, the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model is a
probability distribution on riffle shuffle permutations that has been reported to be a
good match for experimentally observed outcomes of human shuffling, and that forms the
basis for a recommendation that a deck of cards should be riffled seven times in order to
thoroughly randomize it.
>
> The deck of cards is cut into two packets... [t]hen, one card at a time is repeatedly
moved from the bottom of one of the packets to the top of the shuffled deck.

Here we implement the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model, and verify this recommendation of seven
shuffles.
